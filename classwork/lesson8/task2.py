'''You have a list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 0]. Write a function 
"try_to_return_a_number", which will take an argument "number" and raise an exception OddError if number is odd, and ZeroError
 if number is zero. Write a high level function,  which will take an argument "list_of_numbers", 
 go through it in for in loop, put every item from list to "try_to_return_a_number" function, and
 print a number or a message depends on exception on each loop step'''

The result should be sent back to the user via a print statement.'''

Create a program that reads an input string and 
then creates and prints 5 random strings from characters of the input string.'''

'''task4
Write a program that asks the answer for a mathematical expression, 
checks whether the user is right or wrong, and then responds with a message accordingly.'''
